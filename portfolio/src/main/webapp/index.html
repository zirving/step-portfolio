        <h2> Who am I?</h2>

        <p> I am a junior year student at Loyola Marymount University in Los Angeles.
            I am studying Computer Science and Economics, with minors in Philosophy and 
            Mathematics. </p> 

        <p> My professional interests are varied but are united around a central mission of 
            using data and logical methods to find solutions to complex problems. I enjoy 
            coming up with an algorithmic solution to a problem that would be impossible
            for a person to solve. 
            Programming has been one of my primary ways to scratch this problem solving itch. </p>

        <p> I also enjoy learning and teaching. Usually I am reading at least two books at a time, 
            which leads to me finding more and more things I don't know enough about, creating a 
            never ending cycle. Teaching is the other side of learning for me, and I have been a tutor 
            either profressionally or casually for over five years. </p>
        
        <p> Outside of work, I love anything to do with the outdoors. Hiking and camping are some of my favorite 
            ways to get back to nature, and I love the water, enjoy time at the beach, swimming, and wakeboarding. 
            Music is also a passion of mine, and I am always seeking out good music, both new and old. I also play 
            the guitar, and am slowly improving. Baking has also recently become a hobby of mine, 
            and I enjoy making tasty food and sharing it with others. </p>
